# Optimal Design and Scheduling of an Energy System

Group design project for my ENGY 604: Energy Systems Engineering I class. The goal was to develop a model for a hypothetical grid-connected microgrid energy system, and choose from among a set of generating devices how to best serve the local load.

My main contribution was formulating the mathematical MILP models for Part A and Part B, and translating these optimization problems into Pyomo code to be simulated and solved for.

I used Gemini and Claude to help with formulating the MILP and generating the corresponding python code, respectively.

In addition, I set up a multi-objective optimization problem using the Epsilon constraint method to do Pareto frontier analysis.
