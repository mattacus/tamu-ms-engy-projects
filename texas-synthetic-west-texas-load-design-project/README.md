# Texas Synthetic Grid - West Texas Load Design Project

Final design project for my ECEN 615: Methods of Electric Power Systems Analysis class. The goal was to plan, design, and simulate using DC-OPF a new set of five 1 GW loads in West Texas (this could hypothetically represent new AI datacenter demand, as well as other industrial load types). The project files I used are included, as well as some screenshots, datasets, and planning worksheets.

I ended up developing a 500kV transmission corridor in order to service the new loads in a handful of different scenarios. I used the PowerWorld simulator to plan, design, and study the results for this project.
