# Data Science for Process Systems

A collection of data science notebooks for the ENGY 644 class. This class involved high level modeling of energy systems using model predictive control (MPC), and hybrid physics-based and ML approaches.

##

Description:

1.  644_HW_1: A basic input/output feedback linearizing controller model
2.  644_HW_2: Hybrid modeling for a hypothetical small modular nuclear reactor (SMR)
3.  644_Final_Project_solution: Review and discussion of a microgrid energy management system (EMS) using model predictive control
