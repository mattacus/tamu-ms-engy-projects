# newton-raphson-solver

A simple newton-raphson power flow solver, implemented in python. Assumes zero conductance and uses LU decomposition to do matrix inverse operations

##

Description: Python power flow solver for TAMU ECEN 615: Methods of Electric Power Systems Analysis. For this project,
the Github Copilot tool was used to assist in documentation, formatting, language features
(such as working with complex numbers), and some implementation suggestions.

To run:

1.  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2.  Install the required packages: numpy, pandas
3.  Run the script using the command: python solver.py five_bus_example/ for the five bus system
